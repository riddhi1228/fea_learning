# FEA Learning Notes and Experiments

This repository documents my learning journey in finite element analysis (FEA)
and computational mechanics.

## Tools and Software
- SU2 (FEA module)
- ParaView
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- MPI (basic usage)

## What I have done so far
- Ran linear elasticity simulations using SU2
- Worked with boundary conditions (clamped, load, free)
- Generated and visualized stress and displacement fields in ParaView
- Explored SU2 configuration files for structural problems

## Current focus
- Understanding FEA formulation and solver setup
- Studying topology optimization concepts
- Preparing for open-source contributions (GSoC)

## Notes
This repository is intended as a public learning log and will be updated
regularly as I progress.
